Designing the RCE Saskatchewan website

The current website(26/05/2020) of the RCE Saskatchewan is not organized in a proper way. There is a lot of content which has to be shown on the website. 
By the end of this project, we try to design the High-fidelity prototype of the website based on the comments of the RCE Stakeholders and by using our own documents such as Problem definition, Empathy map, User story map etc to achieve customer delight.


All the documents submitted in this section is a group work by all of the group members.
